rar2fs - FUSE file system for reading RAR archives

DESCRIPTION

rar2fs is a FUSE based file system that can mount a source RAR archive/volume
or a directory containing any number of RAR archives and read the contents as
regular files on-the-fly. Non-archived files located in the source directory
are handled transparently.

Both compressed and non-compressed archives/volumes are supported but full
media seek support (aka. indexing) is only available for non-compressed
plaintext archives.

Security note: Encrypted archives require passwords stored in plaintext files.
If security is critical, consider using filesystem-level encryption (e.g., encfs)
in combination with rar2fs.


BUILDING

Standard build:

    autoreconf -f -i
    ./configure --with-unrar=<path-to-unrar-source>
    make
    make install

The UnRAR library source must be obtained separately:
https://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-7.2.1.tar.gz

Automated build (downloads and builds UnRAR automatically):

    ./build-with-unrar.sh

Run './build-with-unrar.sh --help' for options.
